#|  Infer variable-parameter maps by exploiting information stored

(define-category grow ...
  :realization
     (:verb ("grow" :past-tense "grown")
      :etf (svo-passive)) ... )

The set of 'families' that can appear in the etf field of
a simplified realization for a verb are (5/17)
  sv: s, v
  svo: s, v, o
  svol: s, v, o1, o2

#| The map from the phrase is used in decode-shortcut-rdata when it

Setup-rdata processess the :realization field.
If there is an etf in it (marking it as a 'shortcut' style of
  realization), then the field is read by decode-shortcut-rdata 
  which passes along the :mumble field as one of its return arguments.
The next call is to make-realization-data where the initialize method
  on the realization-data class calls setup-mumble-data.

N.b. In the case of phosphorylate, whose variables are spread out
all over, the mapping derived from the ETF interfered with the
explicit mapping in the mumble field.
