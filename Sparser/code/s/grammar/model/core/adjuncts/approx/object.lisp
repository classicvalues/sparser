;;;  version:  August 2023

;; initiated 4/9/91 v1.8.2
;; 0.1 (12/7/92 v2.3) redone in the new semantics. 9/21/93 moved to [adjuncts]
;;     (5/27) added rdata
;; 0.2 (11/17) distinguishing between adverbs and determiners
;;     (9/12) tweeked the autodef
;; 0.3 (9/23/11) Reworked adverbial to use define-adverb. Reworked
;;      the category a little. Reworked determiner case as quantifiers
;; 0.3 (1/4/13) Prety drastic reworking to feed define-function-term
;;      with parameters as an approximator rather than instantiate
;;      one per-se as was done in the 'original' code that's commented
;;      out. (5/26/13) probagated change in deine-adverb's signature
