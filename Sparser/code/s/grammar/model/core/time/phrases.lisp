;; initiated 4/9 v1.8.2
;; 1.0 (12/15/92 v2.3) bumped version to prepare for new semantics
;;     (10/19/94) cleaned up the parts that are out of date
;;     (1/3/98) started adding form rules for adverbs
;;     (1/1/08) Added 'date' and the form and referents to the mapcar,
;;      Added the form rule for them with 's'.
;; 2.0 (4/6/11) Redone as a category with a realization rather than
;;      a map over a set of syntactic rules. This way we get schema
;;      and a basis of reversing it. 
;;3.0  (5/30/2013) generalized prep-time slightly
;;      month/weekday are now realized syntactically as time, thus removed
;;      added numeric-time to prep-time complement, e.g. "at five o'clock," "by two o'clock"
