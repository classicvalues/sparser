;;; standard attributes
;;;---------------------
;; Their values are defined in model/dossiers/qualities.lisp
;; along with their values for comparatives by using the
;; functions these definitions created

(define-attribute color)  ;; "blue" ;;--- not scalar - add parameter
(define-attribute size)   ;; "big"
(define-attribute height) ;; "tall"
(define-attribute width)  ;; "narrow"
(define-attribute length) ;; "long"

(define-attribute amount ;; high, low
    :subcat (modifies-scalar))
;; The word "level" is a bio-scalar in bio, and used extensively
;; so have to prepare for fanout when naming this 'level'

;;--- supply a name for the attribute in a parameter
(define-attribute rate-of-change ;; fast, slow
    ;; vs 'rate' as defined in amounts/measurements.lisp
    :subcat (modifies-scalar))

(define-attribute goodness) ;; better, worst
;; would be 'quality' except that's taken by the upper model
;;//// the attributes are nouns -- morphology makes a hash of a word
;; that ends in 'ness': :inflection-of-noun #<word "goodnesses">
;;                      :noun-inflections (#<word "goodnesses">)
