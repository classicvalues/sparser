;; Routines for sweeping down through the structure of Krisp referents.
;; Initiated 1/11/15 with code from December. 
;; 3/21/2015 SBCL pointed out that binding of pobj and prep variables in PP 
;;  referents was very wasteful
;;  put in a hash table instead. This means that all cases where we were searching 
;;  for the bindings of pob must be replaced by use of (get-prep-pobj value)
;; 4/16/15 The hashtable scheme wasted individuals. Only need to store the PP
;;  as the referent of its edge. Fanout from that change. 
;; 4/28/15 Changed gate of add-new-word-to-catalog to new parameter: 
;;  *collect-new-words* 
;; 6/9/15 Added "strip" routines to reverse the "human-reaable" expressions
;;  created by collect-model. Add strings to stripper for "!recursion!"
;; 11/4/15 Removed the return value form that string case. Doesn't make
;;  sense as something to aggregate.
