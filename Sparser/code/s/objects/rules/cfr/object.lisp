;;;   Version:   October 2023

;; 1.1  (v1.5) added new fields to handle the new rule regime
;; 1.2  (1/29 v1.8) Moved in Binary-rule?
;; 1.3  (7/30 v1.8.6) Added Polyword-rule?
;; 1.4  (2/16/98) added 'schema' field to cfrs.
;;      (2/7/05) added Unary-rule?
;;      (9/16/13) added category-to-apply
;; 1/5/2015 MAJOR CHANGE -- added new field rhs-forms to cfrs, and fill it from the ETF schema -- used to check syntactic plausibility of rule applications
