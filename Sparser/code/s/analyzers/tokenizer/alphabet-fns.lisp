;; initiated 9/21/92 v2.3
;; (4/20/93) added Set-tokenizer-table-entry
;; (8/20) finished it.
;; 0.1 (12/2) Removed the range checks from the set function as meaningless
;;      and fixed a bug
;;     (6/9/94) added character-type predicates.
;; 0.2 (5/31/96) Increased the size of the array to 256.
;;     (2/3/13) added doc that its value is burned in.
;; 0.3 (3/2/14) Added character-entry to be the common access point
;;      for all ranges of character codes.
;;     (3/18/14) Moved in the setup code for Greek characters
;;     (7/30/14) added all-punctuation-chars?

#| the 'out of band' characters (i.e. code points higher than 256)
are defined in an alist in alphabet.lisp that is bound to
the parameter *entries-for-out-of-band-characters* that is
defined there. 

Whenever a new punctuation character is added it has to be
defined. Known punctuation is defined in grammar/rules/words/
punctuation.list. For smaller code points the file makes an
explicit call to define-punctuation. For all other punctuation
it is added to a list in the file that is bound to
*out-of-band-punctuation*. At the bottom of the punctuation file
there is a call to add-punctuation-chars which maps the function
add-punctuation-char over the list. |#

;;--- readout the cache

#| When new characters occur, you can use write-lines-for-out-of-band-cache
 which reads out what's in the cache and writes out the entries for them
 in sorted order.

 You just add that list to the bottom of alphabet.lisp. You have to inspect
 the list by eye to determine which, if any, of the new characters are
 punctuation. Change those entries to be punctuation entries, and then
 go to grammar/rules/words/punctuation.lisp and add definitions for them.

#| When you get that error it's likely because the text you're running
has a UTF-8 character that we don't have an entry for yet. The error message
showed you what the character was visually, and identified the code point
that has to be added to the *entries-for-out-of-band-characters* alist at
the bottom of this file. Your job is to figure out what "normal" character
that corresponds to (e.g. a unicode left-single-quotation-mark corresponds
to an ascii single quote), as least for the purpose of telling the token fsa
how to handle it -- the original character won't be replaced in the token.

This will usually entail a web search. There are lots of unicode web pages.
This is a reasonable choice http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/search.htm
