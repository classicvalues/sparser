#| This is a conceptualization of the relationships among
an entity, its properties ('qualities'), the value of those
properties at a given moment, and the spaces of those values
per se, independent of any of the things that could have them. 

For any attribute, we want to represent

-- A category that says that the attribute is applicable.
It would typically be used as a mixin, and supply the
variable to which values of the attribute are bound.

-- A category for the values the attribute can have. 
For values that have names ("red", "fast", "tall").
We represent the values as instances of this category.

-- The attribute per se. Assuming the attribute is the sort
that has a simple name ("color", "speed", "height") this
representation will supply the referent for the edge over
that word.

-- Because you can talk about an attribute and the thing
it applies to in a maximal projection ("the color of the block",
"the block's color"), there ought to be a way to represent
that. 

-- There are other linguistic factorings of the triple of
attribute, value, and object to which it applies. And there
will need to be 'carriers' for tense/aspect and presumably
the context(s) in which the triple is germane. 

-- For instance there is a predicate projected just from
the value. The simple gloss of this might be, e.g. "being tall".
But we can't just use the attribute value for this, since
we need to be able to represent, e.g. "are never tall.",
so the representation of this predicate needs the right hooks.

-- If we think about predicates then we naturally think about
the predications that arise from applying the predicate to
a 'subject', e.g. "southern Chinese girls are never tall"
