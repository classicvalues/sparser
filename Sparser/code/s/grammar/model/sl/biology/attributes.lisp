#| The parser will do "binding rate" compositionally, and will put
the 'binding' in the process slot of the process-rate object.
Unfortunately, generating from that requires coercing 'binding' 
into a particple in order to provide an adjective realization,
which if further than is worth going just now. (Same issue as we
have with phosphorylated as a preposed modifier.) |#
