;; initiated 11/29/97. Given some content 1/2/01 though punting on the issue of
;; cross-indexing all the different paths down to a subtype that is a specialization
;; of a specialization so that the same object will be found regardless of
;; the sequence in which the specializing terms are seen. Continuing 3/2.
;; 2/8/05 Added making the derived-category to the task of make-subtype and
;; fleshed out its fields more.
;; 0.1 (2/10/05) Allowing individuals (e.g. 'net') to be 'specializing-categories'. 
;; 0.2 (3/14/05) revised the basis of bound/free on the subtype lp to copy what's
;;   already known since otherwise we lose it. (3/17) added mixin-category to cases
;;   in make-subtype. (3/31) Changed use of name-of in make-subtype as fanout from
;;   the change that the routine now returns a word instead of a symbol.
;; 0.3 (2/8/11) 'name-of' is predefined in Clozure, so changing it to 
;;   name-of-individual.
;; 1.0 (5/9/14) Thorough make-over to simplify the operations and tune them
;;   to CLOS and shadows. 
;;   (1/7/15) Wrote one-off-specialization to expedite an issue in
;;   conjunctions. 
;; 6/30/2015 Fix one-off-specialization so that it does-not keep adding copies
;;  of the same super-category when the same DL conjunction individuals.
;; 10/17/15 was convinced it does't make sense
