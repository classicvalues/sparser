;; 0.1 (9/392 v2.3)) Redid them as "form categories", with an indicator on their plists
;; 0.2 (10/12) flushed "mvb" for "verb", 10/24 added common-noun/plural
;;     (12/28) added "text-segment"
;;     (5/11/93) added cases for words where we know their form via
;;      their morphology
;;     (5/21) added unknown-word
;;     (5/28) replaced "proper-noun" at the word level with "proper-name" at the
;;      phrase level
;;     (6/15) added "appositive", (7/8) added advp and adjp, 
;;     (10/22) added proper-adjective
;;     (1/11/94) added "modal" (3/28) added "classifier" (5/24) added deictic-time-word
;;     (6/7) added "mvb"  (7/11) added possessive, possessive/np, reflexive/np
;;     (7/12) added infinitive  (7/13) added noun/verb-ambiguous
;;     (7/29) added comparative (8/3) added noun  (8/5) added verb+passive
;;     (8/23) added verb+object  (9/26) added participle  (9/27) added imperative
;;     (10/6) added 'appositive-prefix'   (10/19) added adjunct  (10/20) definite-modifier
;;     (11/14) added some np discourse descriptors.  (1/24/95) added newline
;;     (4/12) added autodef for adverbs and adjectives.  4/27 tweeked that
;;     and added v-bar   4/30 added appositive-prefix  5/7 added unknown-verb
;;     5/15 added vg/passive and vp/passive for the benefit of CA rules
;;     6/14 added adjunct-to-np and adjunct-to-s
;; 0.3 (6/20) filled the lattice-position field of the categories
;;     (9/12) tweeked the autodef
;; 0.4 (8/16/97) Modified the notion of a form-category to remove the (never yet used)
;;      lattice-position field, thereby allowing them to be defined as simple categories
;;      and used with licenses that don't include the model.  10/18 put it back, but
;;      gated.
;;     (8/31/99) Added 'qp' for quantifier-phrase. (2/5/07) added section-header
;;     (8/8) added pronoun.
;; 0.5 (3/26/08) Added brackets section and a value for possessive.
;;     (5/10/09) Added wh-pronoun. 5/9/09 added question-marker. 7/23/09 added interjection
;;     (2/10/10) Added quantifier. 3/16/10 added paragraph.
;; 0.6 (8/8/11) Converted form-category? to a method so it can take symbols.
;;     (9/29/11) Added two variants on preposition. (11/22/12) Added two conjunctions
;;     (2/8/13) added 'word'.
;; 0.7 (3/14/13) Wrote some predicates that group sets of labels for uniformity
;;      is code that operates over them like the text relations. 3/15 fan-out from
;;      change to pronoun form. 4/9/13 added relative-clause. Lots of little additions
;;      to the predicates before that.
;; 0.8 (5/17/14) Modified ignorable-category? to move number into modifier-category?.
;;     (5/21/14) Added mark-as-form-category so you can make a referential category
;;      e.g. number, look like a form category when you want it to.
;;     (6/9/14) Added mixin adjective-adverb here as nothing else seemed better
;;     (9/26/14) added vp-category?
;;     (10/22/14) Extended the np 'start' (etc.) lists with number and converted them
;;      to defparameter's so they could be updated. 
;;     (10/23/14) Removed vg from verb-category? for the benefit of find-verb
;;     (10/25/14) Added edge-form-adjustment
;; RJB 12/13/2014 added entries for category::post-ordinal in np chunking tables
;;     added parenthetical as an item that can occur in an NP
;; RJB 12/13/2014 more subtle handling of NP chunking to deal with verb+ed cases
;; contrast "direct binding to activated forms of RAS" where "activated" is likely to be a prenominal modifier
;; with "these drugs blocked ERK activity" where "blocked" is the main verb.
;; the key is to end a NG when you hit a verb+ed immediatelyu preceded by a noun, and to prevent that verb+ed from
;; starting another NG (so that it becomes a VG on its own)
;; RJB 12/14/2014 Similar fix for verb+ing as the start of a NG
;; added     ,category::pronoun as a minor-category -- not sure
;; 12/19/2014     ;; partitive construction e.g. "all of these lines"
;; 12/20/2014 add thatcomp for nouns 
;; 1/1/2015 fix ng-head? to allow "that" as the head of an NG (used mostly for that relative clauses)
;; 1/1/2015 block inclusion of initial adjective/modifier when the previous chunk was a copula verb (just check for BE at this time)
;; 1/2/2015 NG chunks that start with a pronoun end with that pronoun -- this needs to by fixed to account for possesive pronouns, of course
;; 1/8/2015 the word HAD cannot occur inside an NP, even though is is HAVE+ED
;; 1/10/2015 revise handling of THAT in ng-start? -- it is almost never the case that THAT is a determiner, it is usually a relative clause marker or a thatcomp marker
;; add relative-clause to *minor-categories* to avoid break in final sweep
;; 1/14/2015 support for thatcomp
;; 1/28/2015 update *vp-categories*, since the verb BE is covered by an edge which isjust category::verb
;; 1/28/15 added *irrelevant-to-discourse-history*.
;; 2/3/15 removed outliers from pronoun-category? 3/13/15 added cases to
;;   *category-hierarchy* along with doc.
;; 3/21/2015 fixed error in ng-head? caught by SBCL
;; 4/24/2015 added whethercomp as a form category (for clauses like "whether RAS phosphorylates MEK..."
;; 4/27/2015 put back verb+ed as an ng internal category, and put quantifier as a possible head
;; 5/8/2015 add new fomr category "verbal-adjunct ;; TENTATIVE, intended for manner-adverbials like "by phsophorylating ..." or
;; purpose adverbials like "for phorsphorylating..." or "to phosphorylate ..."

;; 5/25/2015 added a bunch of categories to support pp-relative-clause processing
;;  pp-wh-pronoun, pp-relative-clause, subject-relative-clause
;; 5/30/2015 added new passive categories
;;(def-form-category  vg+ed) ;; vg with an untensed (no aux or modal) V+ED
;;(def-form-category  vg+passive) ;; vg with an be and V+ED
;;(def-form-category  vp+passive) ;; vg with an be and V+ED
;; 6/5/15 Added grammatical-subject and direct-object to name relationships of a term
;;  (e.g. a pronoun) to its syntactic environment
;; 6/8/2015 tweaked ng-head?  to prevent treating <adverb> <vp+ing> as a NG group
;; 9/6/15 Added number to the list of categories that aren't relevant in a discourse
;;   history. And again 9/24/15
;;     12/15 changed vg/passive and vp/passive to vg+passive vg+passive
