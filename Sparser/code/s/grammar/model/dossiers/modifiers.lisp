;; Created 1/4/13 to group together comparatives, approximators, etc in
;; one place so they're easier to keep track of. (1/9/13) Moved in all
;; the adverbs from words/adverbs1, including the ones with only function 
;; word definitions because their category hasn't been defined yet. 
;; (1/18/13) put in define-position-in-process. 5/22 added "no longer"
;; (5/30/13) added in earlier, sooner as adverbs and function words
;; 5/6/14 Moved in the quantities from its own file
;; 10/29/14 exposed the comparatives. Forgot why they had been commented out.

;; Commenting out some word for collision with stronger forms in bio
;; through 4/20/15 and beyond.

(define-discourse-adverbial "anyway"
    :doc "As in 'we'll do it anyway', which makes sense when
 there was some impediment to doing it, but we're indicating
 that we want to ignore it. 
   Used in utterance-initial position, it has the force of 
 injecting a break into the discourse and a goal of shifting topics, 
 often to a prior topic that was pushed.")
;;/// In (p/s "Let's build it anyway.") the 'anyway' is parsed
;; as an adverb on the verb. It really should be an operator
;; at the discourse level, but we can cross that bridge later.
