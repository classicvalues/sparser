;; Initiated 10/5/14, starting from the code for detecting bio-entities.
;; 10/29/14 added flags to turn off various steps so lower ones
;; could be independently tested. 11/18/14 Reflecting the decomposition
;; of the sweep into a succession of sweeps. 12/18/15 code to create trees 
;; of semantics for treetops -- collect-model-description and semantic-tts.
;; 1/11/15 Moving that code out to interface/grammar/sweep and refining 
;; how it's used. 
;; 1/12/2015 Handle circular structures in seemtree -- needed for verb+ed premodifiers, among others
;; 1.18.2015 fix collection of description of individuals when modifiers referents are categories and not individuals as in "catalytic domains"
;; 1/18/2015 code (a bit sketchy) to extract all entities and all relations after parsing a sentence -- entities-in and relations-in
;; tweaks to all-entities and all-relations. 
;; 4/16/15 Fanout from change in treatment of PPs. 
;; 1.0 4/28/15 Bumped to re-factor. 
;; 5/2/2015 update semtree to support indiv-pattern for pattern matching
;; 5/13/2015 code related to semtree that will (eventually) fin the material needed for MITRE's index cards
;;  itypes-under, process-under, individuals-under...
;; 5/25/2015 collect information to make MITRE index cards
;; 6/8/2015 Catching errors in get-string-from-local-edge-cache
;; 6/10/15 Rearranging to make globals and their management more apparent
;;  and cleaning up debugging code
;; 7/10/2015 new parameter *dont-filter-on-discourse-relevance* that turns off use of discourse relevance filtering
;; to see how many cards that has surpressed
;; 7/20/15 Tweak to note-surface-string to keep it from returning nil.
