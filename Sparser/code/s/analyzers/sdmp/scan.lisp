;;;   Version: June 2023

;; Initiated 2/9/07. Completely redone starting 1/21/13. Adding a 
;; simpler variation 4/1/13. Which uses make-individual-for-dm&p 4/4
;; 7/17/13 Fixed bug in propoagate-suffix-to-segment. 9/18/13 Reified
;; the continuation code so it's easier to maintain. 5/19/14 put
;; guards around missing cases in analyze-segment. 8/7/14 Added possibility
;; of breaking in :trivial when there's no edge over the head or
;; no edge at all.
;; 1.1 (11/11/14) Reduced propagate-suffix-to-segment to a call to
;;  sdm-span-segment since the did the same thing and sdm-span-segment
;;  didn't blindly take the right suffix's form. 
;; 6/13/2015 fix record-any-determiner 
;; we were adding determiners to the base meaning of
;; amino acids, among others, generating individuals
;; with hundreds of determiners
;; 6/28/2015 make sure to record determiners, and to use fom-lattice-description
;; in convert-referent-to-individual

#|  
  The point of this body of code is to heuristically fill in
anything inside a segment that the parser doesn't. It's also
a site for making general observations about adjacency and
modification facts in aid of getting a better picture of
what the phrase denotes.

  It is called from segment-finished within the PTS code in
drivers/chart/psp/pts.lisp after it has invoked the parser
to make any semantic or form edges that the grammar dictates.
