#| Defines the set of 'expressive categories' (see Meteer 1992) that we're
   experimenting with as the top tier of our domain model.  This sort of thing
   is often referred to as an 'upper model'. This is loosely derived from
   the refinements to that model made at Zoesis in 2003.  

   Need some axioms and tighter review before buying in completely.
   Also need a merger with my adoption of Dolce.

;; 0.1 (8/1/11) Moved in the 'top' categories from other parts of the
;;      core so they can be defined before they're referenced. 8/23 added
;;      the first relation. 9/16 added modifier (words;adverbs) tenatively.
;;      9/29 added operator as in the meeaning from the old days.
;;      12/17 added perdurant, not clear how to fit it in correctly.
;; 0.2 (4/5/13) Exposed top and expressible top so there was somewhere
;;      to hand the type variable.
;;     (8/19/13) Trying a stand-alone definition for "relation" to go with
;;      the class. 12/17/13 added scalar-quality and state. 6/9/14
;;      pulled the standalone definition. It was a one-off. 
;; 0.3 (6/16/14) Trying to insert more organization.
;;     (1/12/15) Filled in missing super-types.  1/20/15 added negation
;;      to top. Worth seeing what a good ontologist would do though. 
;; 0.4 (8/10/15) Reorganized for clarity and ease of reading. 
;; 0.5 (9/22/15) pulled the lemmas so the upper model could be loaded early

   "Dolce defines a 'region' class as one of the immediate
 daughters of 'abstract' (the others include 'fact' and 'set)
 Region is then divided into 'temporal', 'physical' aka space,
 and 'abstract'.
   In general, 'region' is taken abstractly here using the notion of
 demarcation or setting boundaries over some domain to pick out a
 particular part of it. You can have a region of the number line, a
 region of a process (e.g. S-phase in cell division), a region of
 space. The emphasis on regions having interiors in which other things
 can be located. The world itself is not cut up into nice parts. Any
 partitionings or identification of regions are arbitrary cognitive
 constructs, which makes them abstract: not situated in time or space.
   This category is called 'abstract-region' because 'region' carries
 a strong conotation of things geographical, and the present model
 has a fairly rich treatment of place and location, which are all physical
 stuff of one sort or anouther leading to defining 'region' as an endurant
 in the things file.
   An earlier version of this class had an 'applicable-domain' slot
 in it to identify 'The kind of stuff this regain demarcates: numbers, cytoplasm,
 curricula, geographical space, etc.', however it not been clear how to
 fill this slot with anything without going second order (i.e. using a
 class), and it's worth exploring that that would come to in some use-case.")

#|  This is the presently unused part of the ontology that started
    with Meteer's study of Talmy for her thesis, as laundered by
    McDonald at Zoesis. It's worth mining this periodically for
    notions that might be worth incorporating into the now Dolce-
    centric upper model. 

;;--- expressible-type  (more of a generation-centric notion)

; This is the category that dominates almost everything in the model.
; These are the things that the world is comprised of - things, actions, 
; properties -- unicorns, raising money, being -really- good.  
;
; You have to think very carefully if you want to introduce something
; into the ontology that isn't a subcategory (doesn't inherit from)
; expressive type. 
; 
; If we ignoring the capabilities provided by language and interpersonal
; talk, everything that you model will get a single category (or a base
; category and some mixins). But people have more options and can express
; the same state of affairs from different perspectives -- the canonical
; example is 'making a decision' and 'deciding', where you shift between
; a thing and an action. These differences correspond here to differences
; in the choice of expressive type and could be made for tactical reasons
; within the text planner.
;
(define-category expressible-type
  :instantiates nil
  :specializes top)

; This is the natural choice for a value restriction that can accept 'anything'.
; All the categories for the things we can mention/talk about in language
; fall under this category. 



;;--- categories that are classifications of effects rather than stuff

; Grunts, expression of pain, exclamations, and the like are the natural
; province of this category.  It is sometimes used when the motivation
; seems to be immediate and direct rather than involving any sort of
; considered choice. The best theory on this sort of 'direct pass through'
; notion is from Amanda Stent.
;
(define-category direct-expression-of-intent
  super-category expressible-type) ;; // might want to be 'top'



; The speaker's intent gets converted to the instruction to carry out
; a particular 'dialog-move' when it crosses the line and initiates the
; generation process. Dialog moves are basic things like questioning or 
; asserting a proposition, as well as smaller ones like evoking a person's
; name or adding a tag that disambiguates an anaphor.  
;
; A dialog move necessarily involves someone (something?) who's speaking,
; who they're speaking to, and the content of what they say -- which is
; reflected in the variables associated with this category (though they're
; not restricted to just this category  -- there's always a speaker and
; an interlocutor (or several interlocutors/hearers/the-audience) and
; there's (nearly) always content. Remember that variables have a life
; of their own independent of categories. Categories can insist on having
; certain variables (their slots), and can impose value restrictions on
; them that (in principle, but the implementation is weak) can vary from
; category to category.
;   Subcategories of dialog move will often have a richer descrimination
; of their content, e.g. motive+action, deny+reassert, which is reflected
; in their choice of variables.
;
; An important subclass of dialog moves (which so far its hasn't seemed
; useful to break out) are 'speech acts' which are being read here very 
; narrowly as the classic set of actions achieved through the direct use 
; of language: promising, explicit naming/proclaiming (e.g. the act that
; makes you married), denying, etc. 

(define-category dialog-move
  super-category top

         (content . expressible-type)
         (center . individual) ;; might have to elevate the v/r
         ))

; The canonical slot, 'content', is for what it is that's said to the interlocutor.
; The initial motivation comes from Forbid, where there are several choices that
; make the speaker and hearer explicit in addition to the obvious command where
; they're implicit.  The content field is the basis of the weight of the
; message nodes that wrap dialog moves. The additional weight from explicit
; mention of the interlocutors is unlikely to matter.
  



; Rhetorical is a category only because we use categories to organize
; choice sets. (Essentially the same is true for dialog-move though they 
; often are realized by verbs, e.g. "promise", and something rhetorical would
; never that lexically explicit.)  
;
; It is the classification for the intuitive rhetorical moves like hedging
; or emphasizing, and also for stylistic effects (e.g. sentence length),
; and also for labeling individuals like maybe-add-both' that provide
; carriers for alternative choices that add very little to the semantic
; content being realized, and that are factored out so that they can save
; us space by appearing as follow-ons to choices rather than multiplying
; the choices.

; This is a super-category over states and events and such that provides

; of thinking about it is due to Talmy.



;;--- situations

(define-category situation
  super-category anchored-in-time)

; The terms 'situation' and 'state of affairs' pretty much cover the same
; territory, so the difference here is technical.  A state-of-affairs object
; is a way to model a complex situation as a set of concrete events, states,
; and participants by bundling them into a single envelop that a very
; early decision process picks through.  Situations are used almost as

; phrases like "what's the big deal?"



;;--- events 

(define-category eventuality

; 'Eventuality is a term introduced by Emmond Bach to abstract
; events away from (what amounts to) their tense. We have the same
; eventuality ("Marie <get> a bicycle") whether it's a goal for the
; future, what's happening right now in the store, or happened years
; ago.

  super-category action-upon-a-patient)

; This set of specific kinds of eventualities is just the tip of the
; iceburg for reifying the relationships between the participants in
; an eventuality.  I can see do it thoroughly as a way to control
; what kinds of adjunctions you can make to specific base categories 
; of objects, which would let the generator make accurate (felicitous)
; compositions on its own without getting the message-builder involved
; beyond just specifying the intended rhetorical effect / dialog move.




;;--- actions 

(define-category action
  super-category expressible-type)

; If you abstract the agent/subject away from an eventuality you get an
; action: "swimming off Dorchester beach in January", "kissing", "kissing
; your wife".  These pick out generic things in the world rather than
; actual ones -- for that we have eventualiies and states. If it were useful
; to model something along the same lines as the grammatical decomposition
; of a clause (sentence) into subject and predicate, you'd have an individual
; in the subject and an action in the predicate.

; an instance of this category.




;;--- qualities

; The term 'quality' is the choice of the current ontology literature (though
; it goes back to Aristotle) for what might otherwise be called   a 'property'
; or an 'attibute'. Those words come from the intimate association of these
