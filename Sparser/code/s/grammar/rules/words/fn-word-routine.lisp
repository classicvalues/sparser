;;;      File:   "fn word routine"
;;;    Module:   "grammar;rules:words:"
;;;   Version:   May 2023

;; 0.1 (12/17/92 v2.3) redid the routine so it was caps insensitive and handled
;;      bracketing.
;; 0.2 (5/15/93) Added Function-word? and the marker on the word's plist
;; 0.3 (1/12/94) Having bracket assignment first remove any old brackets so that
;;      it's easy to make revisions.
;; 0.4 (7/29) extended the code to be able to handle polywords
;; 0.5 (8/7) removed its 'etypecase' and made the 'otherwise' nil.
;; 0.6 (10/24) embelleshed check to let brackets come in as bracket objects
;; 0.7 (11/16) added keyword for form category
;;     (5/12/95) fixed glitch in format stmt.
;;     (7/31/11) factored out backet operations as assign-brackets-to-word.
;;      and added make-minimal-word-form-rule
;; 0.8 (1/4/13) Moved in a generalized version of the define-adverb function
;;      that correctly build individuals and categories for meaning-bearing
;;      function words. (5/28/14) Smidgen of doc and clean-up. 
;; 0.9 (5/30/14) Adding more options to define-function-term to allow more
;;      tailoring of the results. 6/14/14 Replaced literal listing of POS
;;      bracket choices with new lists of them from rules/brackets/assignments.
;;     (8/31/14) Moved in define-isolated-function-word which fits better here.

  "Does for deliberately defined modifiers the same thing as is done for
   Comlex or morphologically identified nouns or verbs in grammar/rules/
   brackets/assignments.lisp. It creates a new category for this word
   (the string argument), where the name of the category is based on
   the word plus the optional 'discriminator' symbol. If that category
   name is the same as one that's already been defined, it will signal
   an error unless the *ignore-redefine-warnings* has been dynamically
   bound to non-nil. 
     If there are values for the mixins, bindings, documentation, 
   rule-label, or restrict parameters they are folded into the definition
   of the category in the normal way.
     To facilitate the possibility of lexically-specific k-methods,
   we also create one individual of this category and make that the
   referent of the unary rule that's created. We pass that individual
   to make-corresponding-mumble-resource to be sure it reverses.
     The supercategory of the to-be-created category can be
   specified by the 'super-category' argument. It defaults to 'adverbial'.
     The 'form' argument names the category that will be the form on the
   unary rule this creates. It also determines the choice of brackets,
   mirroring the choices in the setup code used with Comlex.
     The 'tree-family' argument should be a list of full ETF names; see example
   in define-adverb. 
     'rule-label' has the same impact as it does in the definition of an
   ordinary category. It determines the label on the generated rules, which
   will otherwise be the generated category.
     'word-variable' is the name of the variable to use to associate
   the word with the category in its bindings field. It defaults to
   name, but that default assumes the variable is in fact defined
   on the supercategory. 
      This pattern does not use the 'lemma' to hold the word that refers
   to the category since these 'categories' are single-purpose and
   only instantiated once. 
     For getting subcategorization information from Comlex the :subcat-info
   argument dictates which POS entry to use. Legal values are noun, verb, 
   adjective, and adverb."
