;;;  version:  September 2023

;; n.b. remember that we also have standalone-directions ("left") and adjectival
;; directions ("lefward"). All of these 'spatial prepositions' create locations
;; by combining with an np: "over the house"

;; initiated 11/25/99 by moving in selected prepositions from [words;prepositions2].
;; 8/13/07 Added "beyond" and "past"
;; 6/26/09 Added "out"
;; 7/23/09 Added "ahead"

(in-package :sparser)

;;--- these are defined as sequencers in modifiers.lisp
;;  We need to sort it out (ddmm 7/29/22)
