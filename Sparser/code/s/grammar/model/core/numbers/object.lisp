;; 1.2 (7/19/92 v2.3) made over as "real" category. 8/4/94 finished princ routine
;;     (10/3) improved the printer.  11/15/95 added a sort routine.
;; 1.3 (6/12/99) Added referential category for multiplier. 6/25 Added a realization
;;      for number. (9/20) moved over set-illion-distribution since it makes more
;;      sense here along with its category.
;;     (1/10/15) consolidated find-or-make routines here
