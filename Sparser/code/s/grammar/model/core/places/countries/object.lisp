;;;  version:  April 2020

;; 1.0 (10/12/92 v2.1) introducing new semantics
;; 1.1 (9/7/93 v2.3) adding a define routine and a realization
;;     (1/18/94) added autodef form.  4/11 added String/country
;;     (9/12) tweeked the autodef. (1/31/99) stashed the rules on the plist
;;     (8/6/07) Changed treatment of adjectives to accommodate Fire's dm&p.
;; 1.2 (7/21/11) Added ethnicities since they pattern essentially the same
;;      way. Removed the new-dm&p constraint, which was for making
;; 1.3 (3/4/13) Reworked define-country to not do anything fancy with
;;      the adjective form because places/countries/relation.lisp will
;;      handle that just from the adjective. Added brackets 3/6/13
;; 1.4 (6/14/13) reworked the def form a bit. 
;; 1.5 (9/25/13) Added city option to the countries def form.
