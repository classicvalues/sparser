;; initiated 5/7/94 v2.3
;; 0.1 (10/24) it was attempting to do checks with words rather than literals
;; 0.2 (12/5) debugged it on :multiple-initial-edges.  Fleshed out a stub 2/2/95
;;     (3/7/07) Added debugging information - left scan can get into a loop
;;     (7/28/14) experimented with alternatives, but didn't change anything.
;; 0.3 (9/10/14) Parser had been ignoring words, so it misses rules with 
;;     literals in them like measurement -> number + "fold". 9/11/14 ripped out
;;     some of that because the actual problem was upstream and kept edges
;;     from being put over the literals. 
;; 0.4 (12/10/14) Made try-combination-to-the-left/bounded throw if it
;;     encountered a word. 
;; 0.5 (1/9/15) Changed the return value to include the edge as well as the layout
;; 0.6 (6/2/15) Cloned the entry point so that we could have a different
;;      version with a different rule policy. 8/7/15 did it again for
;;      parse-between-parentheses-boundaries
