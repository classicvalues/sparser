;; initiated 1/92, fixed end-of-source glitch 3/13
;; Added the straight-through case for a word explicitly 6/26
;; 1.0 (9/25/92 v2.3) redone for new tokenizer
;; 1.1 (11/2) tweeked to make the alignments work correctly given the
;;      difference between punctuation and other tokens.
;; 1.2 (11/11/93) added a switch that directs the display output to
;;      the window for the lexicographer's workbench
;; 1.3 (5/2/94) added flag to control adjusting to a fixed line length
;; 1.4 (5/3) added 'position' parameter that's passed through to the text window routine
;; 1.5 (5/19) tweeked parameterization of adjustment so that it could be
;;      rebound during the course of an article.
;; 1.6 (6/9) fixed a fencepost error in swapping buffers.
;; 1.7 (12/12/94) added an offset based on *number-of-characters-to-subtract*
;;      to work with the token-level 'hiding' of every-terminal tags.
;;     (8/24/14) Added actual-characters-of-word to help reify bio entities
;;      correctly.  
;; (1/21/16) Added extract-string-spanned-by-edge to improve look of tts.
