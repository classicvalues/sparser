;; Broken out of no-brackets-protocol 11/17/14 as part of turning the
;; original single-pass sweep into a succession of passes. Drafts of
;; four passes finished 11/19/14.
;; RJB 12/18/2014   handle case of A, B, and C (i.e. comma before conjunction)
;;  use correct function right-treetop-at/edge in short-conjunctions-sweep -- handle case of PD198u7 and sorafenib.
;; 1/18/2015 Allow conjunctions of an ambiguous word and another word (or ambiguous word)
;; 2/5/15 Introduced fsa's on edges and words. 2/8/15 fixed bug in them
;; SBCL caught type error in short-conjunctions-sweep -- fixed
;; 4/19/15 adapting pattern-sweep to the case where two edges from prior
;;  pass are over words that aren't separated by a space ("20%")
;; 4/28/15 Added scan-words-loop. 8/9/15 added assess-parenthesized-content
;; and an acronym handler. 2/5/16 Put in a handler for known words.
;; 2/10/16 make over polyword-check to open-code its caps-vs-lower check
;; and try both if needed.

#| 3/27/17 ddm -- In at least two of the "phase 3" articles from HMS
      there are abbreviated months, e.g. "Mar. 2009", and the period is
      not (yet) being correctly recognized as indicating an abbreviation
      rather than an end-of-sentence marker. During the word-level completion 
      sweep, applying the abbreviation creates an edge whose end-point
      is beyond the end-pos (the end position is the end position of the
      overly-short sentence.), which leads to a tight infinite loop.
      To avoid this, we look for having walked beyond the end of the
      populated chart, as indicated by the next pos-terminal being nil.
      (Though that doesn't work when the chart was already filled by longer 
      sentence. In the presenting case today the bad length sentences
      were at the beginning of a paragraph when the chart had just been
      deliberately emptied.)
      When we detect this in word-level-completion-sweep we just return
      and leave the loop because we want to continue on to the final word-level
      sweep. When we detect it there in terminal-edges-sweep (actually in the
      macro it and only expands) we throw to end-of-sentence, which finishes
      this whole level.
      Test with this to see the exact point of failure and the short
      sentences.
