;; Initiated 12/28/18 to tabulate rule and semantic function usage
;; and correlation with test passages in texts.

#| This codes keeps a tally of what rules are used, as well as which
syntactic functions are used by those rules (principally syntactic
rules) in order to interpret them.

The needed structure and cross-records are set up as part of post-processing.
The rule counting itself is pretty lightweight and happens automatically,
i.e. there's no governing switch. 

The recording accumulates as you run over more texts. If you want a clean
start call reinitialize-rule-recording, which will reset the pre-run 
accumulators. 

We only make a record of binary rules. This record includes the actual
text of the left and right edges that were composed, as well as the
entire sentence there were in. (Need to extending this to the DA rules.)
Still working on how best to display this information.


Usage: Before you want to start recording you need to populate the
  data that relates rules to their syntactic functions by calling

     (collect-syntactic-function-usage)

  The rules that have been recorded (i.e. have executed since you
launched your session or run reinitialize-rule-recording) are listed
in *rules-ever-fired*

  Report-syntactic-function-usage prints out a list of the syntactic 
functions that were invoked by any of the rule that were fired.

  Report-rules-by-count does the comparable thing for each of the
rules, including any DA rules.
