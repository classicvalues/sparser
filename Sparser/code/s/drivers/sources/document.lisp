;; initiated 4/25/15 to driving reading from a fully populated
;; article object. Continually modifying/adding routines through
;; 5/18/15. 
;; 6/8/2015 better rejection of sections that shouldn't be parsed.
;; 7/6/2015 commented out utility function show-paragraph-sents to help debug sentence
;; segmentation
;; Define a dummy action for read-from-document on a title-text section
;;  this was causing a major blowout (in terms of writing error messages) in the 
;;  overall test when reading document #65 PMC1702556
;; 9/9/15 Flushed the section globals here in favor of the ones
;;  with their object definitions.
