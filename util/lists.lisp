;; initiated 12/30/93 v2.3.  4/11/95 added nil-checkers. 
;; 8/24/10 moved in quote-every-second-one from forms/categories
;; (3/9/11) Reworked to fit in ddm-util. (7/31) Added lowercase-tree
;; (3/8/13) Changed pl to not return the list as its value. Very messy
;;  to deal with in case of list-per-run-init-forms. Added splice-out-nth-element
;; (3/24/16) Dropped unused functions, added some new ones, merged alists.
