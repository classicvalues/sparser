;;; version: June 2016

;; Initiated 3/2/14. 5/22/14 Added synonyms field to def-bio.
;; 6/9/14 Pulled types out from regular kinds. 7/24/14 reorganized.
;; 9/8/14 lifted taxonomy out to its own file, added keyword to
;; inhibit plurals, defaults to allow plurals. Working on nits
;; to make the parser happy through 1/6/15
;; 3/21/2015 -- revised make-typed-bio-entity
;; SBCL caught fact that some words are actually polywords here...
;; 4/19/15 Added stub for handling acronyms.
;; 5/16/2015 attempt (not quite working) to define get-mitre-id which
;; tries to get the MITRE-LINK value for a protein (for example).
;; 11/12/15 Finished bio-entity => protein routine.
;; 2/5/16 added handle-unknown-word-as-bio-entity

assume that they were bio-entities, since that would at least
give us something we could refer to in rules particularly
context sensitive ones. We also burned that into a rule
so we'd have a remember these as a side-effect across
sentences and documents. Now (2/5/16) we just lookup the 
individual for the bio-entity since we may have encountered
it before and then make the edge but don't record anything
which means that when we encounter it again we'll repeat
the process.
