;;;  version:  September 2021

;; [object] initiated 5/28/93 v2.3
;; 0.1 (12/30) allowed the case of the name-word maker being passes an already
;;      converted name-word instead of a word
;; 0.2 (1/7/94) grossly simplified the indexing
;;     (1/31) added special print routine for name-words
;;     (4/5) added Name-word-for-word
;; 0.3 (10/3) redid the indexing of name-words. 10/12 added flag around the data checks
;; 0.4 (4/19/95) reworked name-word creation to use the actual uppercase instance
;;      rather than the lc-word it gets passed
;; [name word] broken out as its own file 4/20 as part of changing the design
;; to make these objects permanent
;;     (4/30) added sort routine, added another keyword to ../silent
;;     (5/22) added Make-name-word-silent
;;     (9/13) added sort routine
;; 0.5 (1/1/96) hacked the name-word creating routines to work with edges that
;;      span more than one word.
;;     (5/30/99) fixed format glitch in  Some-name-element-is-new?.
;; 0.6 (3/15/05) Sorted out issue ther about ordinals vs. positions in sequences.
;;     (1/6/07) +apple'd call to define-sort-function 3/8 added define-name-word.
;;     (8/29/09) Fixed some odd capitalizations.
;; 0.7 (2/13/13) Added a name-of variable to name word to allow acronyms to
;;      link to what they name since they're not one of the words in the
;;      original name, plus operations to manage that. 6/10/13 Got a polyword
;;      as a name-word, so generalized the predicates plist functions.

;;; linking -- name-of
;;;--------------------

#| The name-of variable, which was designed to link a name-word to
 a collection of all the names it is part of, is problematic when
 we are using the description-lattice to manage individuals.
   This is because the lattice mechanics arrange that every new binding
 creates a new, more specific, individual. This is at odds with the
 original design where individuals were rigid. 

 I'm emulating the effect of the name-of variable by using a function
 of the same name that's based on a table. The table has to be managed,
 which right now (9/15/21) is still being worked out.
