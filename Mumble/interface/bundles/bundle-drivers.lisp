;; ChangeLog:
;;  8/99 Added minimal-bundle-driver to handle quantifier phrases.
;;  6/21/00 Made PROCESS-NP-ACCESSORIES operate on its accessories only if they
;;   are present rather than presuming that they are. Leaves more responsibility
;;   in the hands of the lspec-constructor, but aleviates the urge to use
;;   less specific bundles when dealing with nps.
;;  7/9 Changed the pronominalization criteria from :reducible to :in-focus.
;;  8/30 Removed the constraints in Process-np-accessories that any of the
;;   accessories are requied. Number and determiner-policy had been required,
;;   person and proper-name weren't.
;; 11/20/13 Started the makeover in earnest.
