;; Created 8/24/21 to organize the process of comlex-derived words
;; to a file of categories defining them.

(in-package :sparser)

#| There are two ways into this process, bulk handling of a large list
of words, and the retail handling of a single word at a time when a new
unknown word is encountered while parsing a document. 
  
Both go through the same choke point, the 'setup' functions in grammar/
rules/brackets/assignments.lisp. Comlex based lookup (unpack-primed-word)
calls them directly, as do most cases in assign-morph-brackets-to-unknown-word
when they can assign a POS.

The setup functions are setup-common-noun, setup-verb, setup-adjective, and
setup-adverb. Besides their normal actions to create categories and rules
for the words they are passed, they have all been augmented by calls to
make-category-form. When it flag is up, make-category-form makes calls to
one of the assemblers in make-definitions.lisp. These return the s-expression
they created, which is then pretty printed to the designated output stream.

The gating parameter - *incrementally-save-comlex-categories* - is defined
to default to nil. It is turned on in the dynamic extent of create-word-definitions
and create-category-from-word (used for verb+prep definitions). We have the
option doing this at normal runtime, where we would make stream to a file
that we append to.

#| 10/7/21 The verbs dossier motivated the creation of four verbs in order
 to support verb-preposition combinations:
sp> *words-added-by-create-category*
   (#<word "work"> #<word "decision"> #<word "look"> #<word "carry">)
 But because that process goes through setup-verb we get to this form
 which looks for other prepositions and creates those combinations
 as well, which then print to the repl.
