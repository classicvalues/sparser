#| "information" is an 'information-functional-objects' in Trips
  < functional-object < abstract-object-nontemporal

JDP: information appears to be a primitive notion

Information and goals are both things one can 'have' or 'get'
They both can be put to use for some purpose
  and their suitability for that purpose can be judged: 'relevant'
Information carries a notion of scalar quantity: 'more', 'enough'

Fixed text: "I don't have enough information to do that."
invites this reply: "What (else) do you need to know?"

  theory of knowledge and belief, which we don't need to just talk about

  without being more specific than that. It's just a primitive that's
  not analyzed further.
  Notes:
    Information can be described or characterized, and it can be
  embodied in a medium that acts as a container for the information.
    Information must be distinguished from the the medium that carries
  it (bitstream, music score, book). The same information can be
  carried by different media and in different instances,
  i.e. information can be copied without losing its identity (which
  makes it a very special kind of stuff and drives the MPAA nuts).
  We can talk about the fidelity of a copy (compare different people
  singing the Star Spangled Banner at ball games) but poor copies are
  still copies of the same information.")

;;;---------------
;;; Having a name
;;;---------------

#| Ordinary simple attributes (color, size) are realized as
adjectives. Since the suite of these attributes can largely
be anticipated, the treatment in core/kinds/attribution.lisp
defines their semantic relationship in terms of variables
that are incorporated into the target categories as mixins
(see, e.g., the definition of 'object' in core/mid-level/
ontology.lisp). 

Perhaps because of their salience in human relationships,
names have a more diverse set of realizations and typically 
establish the relationship using verbs.  

  "my name is Inigo Montoya"
  "we call him Daniel"

The name attribute, per se, is the category 'name', which
is defined with the other standard attributes in mid-level/
attributes.lisp. The basic semantic model for names is given
in the names, people, companies, and location directories
of grammar/model/core/, and elaborated in several model/sl/'s.
While the core/names/ module can be assumed, the other grammar 
modules are not available in every configuration

'Names' like 'Daniel' or 'MEK' are attribute 'values', like
'red' and 'big'.  The entity to whom we're attributing the
name fills the third variable of that (inherited) has-attribute
category. 

Note that names ('proper names') are individuals that instantiate
some subcategory of the category 'name'
