(defun define-standard-verbs ()) ;; for retrieving this file


;; Gathers verbs from diverse specific sources into one place.
;; Tipping was the need to have access to prepositions now that we can
;; specify them with verbs, but in any event it makes things easier
;; to keep track of.

#|  N.b. if one of these verbs is also used in biology, there should
be an entry for it in bio;overrides.lisp that expunges it, 
or alternatively an entry in (e.g.) bio;verbs.lisp that specializes it
and provides biology-specific restrictions on its varibles. |#
