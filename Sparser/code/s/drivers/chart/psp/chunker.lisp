;; Initiated 10/8/14
;; ddm: 10/16/14 Rewrote identify-chunks. Commented out lines anticipating 
;; words not covered by edges. Added traces.

;; RJB 12/13/2014 changes to method "remaining-forms" and to code in
;; categories.lisp to provide more subtle handling of NP chunking to deal
;; with verb+ed cases contrast "direct binding to activated forms of RAS"
;; where "activated" is likely to be a pre-nominal modifier (from j2) with
;; "these drugs blocked ERK activity" where "blocked" is the main verb.
;; the key is to end a NG when you hit a verb+ed immediately preceded by a
;; noun, and to prevent that verb+ed from starting another NG (so that it
;; becomes a VG on its own)
;; RJB 12/19/2014     ;; partitive construction e.g. "all of these lines"
;; 1/1/2015 break out adjective/modifier from start of NG if the preceding
;;  chunk was a copula and fix handling of chunks terminated by the end of
;;  the sentence
;; 1/12/2015 Start on new NG interpreter parse-ng-interior -- works modestly well
;; 1/14/2015 New whack-a-rule type interpreter for NG and VG chunks
;; 1/17/2015 NEW VERSION -- should handle ambiguities in base edge
;; 1.28.2015 better handling of VG chunks -- don't allow two finite verbs
;; in the chunk (excpet for BE, HAVE and modals)
;; 2/24/2015 allow determiner and quantifier before number in an NG (used
;; to be that we didn't allow "all three drugs"
;; 4/14/15 Added tts to top of chunking operation when trace-parse-edges
;;  is running. 
;; 4/27/2015 Improved handling of verb+ed case -- tension is between
;; keeiping it in the NP and losing a reduced relative, or breaking up the
;; NP to allow for the verb form. Still need to review this.
;; 5/23/2015 -- handling wh-pronouns as NPs for relative clause PPs ("in
;; which ...", "from whose") while not allowing them as as determiner-like
;; modifiers for the start of a questioned NP ("which protein") handle
;; partitive without OF -- "all these ..."
;; 6/5/2015 don't run over the final period in scanning for chunk boundary

to mark an infinitive complement, the infinitive per-se. E.g. overnight #3,

  The motivating example was ERK #7, where the stored 'best' parse
grossly miss-analyzed "shown consistently to be deficient", so the
question might be how can we mark a tocomp from an infinitive rather
than a bare "to".  |#
